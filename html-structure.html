            <li>Block-level content aligns everything veritically->flow content</li>
            <li>Inline conent aligns everything vertically->phrasing content</li>
            <li>Block-level element CANNOT be contained in inline elements</li>
            <p>For example, divs are by default Block-level content whereas spans are automatically inline.</p>

                Heading tags should NOT be used for styling they are used to rank importance. They may help SEO rankings. Other important
                tags include: 
                <header>
                    This is the header element. The <nav>link here</nav> this navigation tag helps link the website to other parts of the
                    site. Next, outside of the header element:
                </header>

                <article>Article tag, I have not reaaallllly....seem this</article>
                <footer>Tag, this is for the ending. </footer>

                Semantic elements give better structure.

            <li>Block-level content aligns everything veritically->flow content</li>
            <li>Inline conent aligns everything vertically->phrasing content</li>
            <li>Block-level element CANNOT be contained in inline elements</li>
            <p>For example, divs are by default Block-level content whereas spans are automatically inline.</p>

                Heading tags should NOT be used for styling they are used to rank importance. They may help SEO rankings. Other important
                tags include: 
                <header>
                    This is the header element. The <nav>link here</nav> this navigation tag helps link the website to other parts of the
                    site. Next, outside of the header element:
                </header>

                <article>Article tag, I have not reaaallllly....seem this</article>
                <footer>Tag, this is for the ending. </footer>

                Semantic elements give better structure.

                copyright need to be used is &copy;
                if you always wanted multiple words to stay on the same line. Use this between the words instead of
                a space. Hello&nbsp;how&nbsp;are&nbsp;you!

                <h>
                    Creating links!!!!!INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OMG XD
                </h>

                First: Internal linking structure: 
                &lt;a href="internal-link-file-name.html"&gt;
                    The item you want to be linked CONTENT CONTENT CONTENT
                    Make sure that the path is correct tho
                &lt;/a&gt;

                Second: External linking structure;
                EVERYTHING IS THE SAME

                <div>
                    Use a div tag within an a tag because it contains a whole area. This is good for when you link images.
                </div>

                When you want to link to an external source:
                use both href and target="_blank" and the new one will be opened in a new tab

                Third: Linking to other sections within your own page
                href = #section-id
                ... this will link to the section with the same id omg WHAT
            </p>

            <p>
                <h1>
                    INCLUDING IMAGES :D
                </h1>

                <!-- THIS IS AN HTML COMMENT OMG HEHEE-->
                &lt;img src="imagelink" alt="used for visually impaired"&lt;
                Make sure to specify the width and height of image!
                <li>Should I use css or within the tag?</li>
                <li>Used to make the image load faster</li>
            </p>
